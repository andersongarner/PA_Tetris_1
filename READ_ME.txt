----------------------------------- TETRIS -----------------------------------

--------------- IMPORTANT!!! ---------------
The game.py file is the one that fulfills the 600x800 requirement, but it is not
the best way to experience our game.

If you have a 1920x1080 display, please run the game_full_size.py instead.
In our opinion it looks a lot nicer.

Also, if you are on a laptop, please plug it in, as many devices will not run
as fast on battery, and this makes a difference for us.

The program runs OK on our machines, but reach out if there are issues.
